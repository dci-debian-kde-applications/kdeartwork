    | Credit where credit is due
    | 
    | The cdrom icons are not 100% original. the disc part of the image while modified was created by someone else.
    | I dont know who did them originally but credit partly goes to you.
    | The Gimp icon is care of Tigert.  Various other things are modified icons from Noia and Crystal.
